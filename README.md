# Mermaid parse a scala parser for mermaid format

A simple parser for the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) format.

This small library allows to store a representation of a parsed mermaid graph into a case class (by parsing a string
that represents the graph) or do the reverse by rendering a case class to a mermaid string (by a serialization
mechanism).

You can get the mermaid case class representation by running the following string interpolation:

```scala
import com.mermaidparse.chart.flowchart._

val interpolatedGraph =
  mermaid"""
           |flowchart LR
           |  subgraph TOP
           |    direction TB
           |    subgraph B1
           |        direction RL
           |        i1 -->f1
           |    end
           |    subgraph B2
           |        direction BT
           |        i2 -->f2
           |    end
           |  end
           |  A --> B
           |  B1 --> B2
           |  """

      Node(id = "B", text = "B", shape = Squared),
      Node(id = "B1", text = "B1", shape = Squared),
      Node(id = "B2", text = "B2", shape = Squared)
    ),

      Link(
        source = Node(id = "A", text = "A", shape = Squared),
        destination = Node(id = "B", text = "B", shape = Squared),
        text = None,

        maybeDirection = Some(value = TB),
        nodes = List(),
        connections = List(),
        subGraph = List(
          SubGraph(
            name = SubGraphName(id = None, name = "B1"),
            maybeDirection = Some(value = RL),
            nodes = List(

                  lineType = Continuous
                ),
                length = 2

                length = 2
              )
            ),
            subGraph = List()
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

You can also do the reverse by calling:

```scala
import com.mermaidparse.chart.flowchart._

val first = Node(id = "c1", text = "c1", shape = Squared)
val second = Node(id = "a2", text = "a2", shape = Squared)

val myGraph = FlowChart(
  direction = TB,
  nodes = List(
    first,
    second
  ),
  connections = List(
    Link(
      source = first,
      destination = second,
      text = None,
      connection = ConnectionType(
        direction = LeftToRight(tipType = Some(value = Standard)),
        lineType = Continuous
      ),
      length = 2
    )
  ),
  subGraph = List(
    SubGraph(
      name = SubGraphName("ide1", name = "[one]"),
      maybeDirection = None,
      nodes = List(
        Node(id = "a1", text = "a1", shape = Squared),
        second
      ),
      connections = List(
        Link(
          source = Node(id = "a1", text = "a1", shape = Squared),
          destination = second,
          text = None,
          connection = ConnectionType(
            direction = LeftToRight(tipType = Some(value = Standard)),
            lineType = Continuous
          ),
          length = 2
        )
      ),
      subGraph = List()
    )
  )
)

println(myGraph.render())
```

The library is possible thanks to the Liaoyi fastparse2 library.
